## PyMDP -- A python implementation of Markov Decision Process (MDP)

Hello there! This would be a simple and straightforward implementation of a general Markov Decision Processes in Python.

Almost all problems in Reinforcement Learning are theoretically modelled as maximizing the return in a Markov Decision Process.

I plan to make my own implementation of RL modules in the future.

## Here are the things left to do:-

- [x] Implementation of a class and type for stochastic transition function.
- [x] Implementation of a class and type for States.
- [x] Implementation of a general reward function.
- [x] Implementation of a DP algorithm for calculating non-stationary Optimal Policy in case of finite horizon.
- [x] Implementation of a value-iteration algorithm for Optimal Policy calculation in case of infinite horizon.
- [ ] using multithreading and parrallel computing for calculations of Optimal Policy.
- [x] Test cases to verify correctness in case of finite Horizon.
- [x] Build custom transformers for states, actions, and transition function matrix in PySpark. 
- [x] Build custom estimator for calculation of optimal policy. 
- [x] Set up MongoDB clusters, to store data. 
- [ ] Build full data pipeline using PySpark and PyMongo.
