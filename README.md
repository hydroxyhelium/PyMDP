## PyMDP -- A python implementation of Markov Decision Process (MDP)

Hello there! This would be a simple and straightforward implementation of a general Markov Decision Processes in Python. 

Almost all problems in Reinforcement Learning are theoretically modelled as maximizing the return in a Markov Decision Process.
 
I plan to make my own implementation of RL modules in the future. 

## Here are the things left to do:-

- [ ] Implementation of a class and type for stochastic transition function.
- [ ] Implementation of a class and type for States.
- [ ] Implementation of a class and type for Inputs.
- [ ] Implementation of a general reward function.
- [ ] Implementation of a DP algorithm for calculating non-stationary Optimal Policy in case of finite horizon.
- [ ] Implementation of a value-iteration algorithm for Optimal Policy calculation in case of infinite horizon.
- [ ] using multithreading and parrallel computing for calculations of Optimal Policy.
